CSV DATA COMPARISON AND MERGING - STEP-BY-STEP LOGIC EXPLANATION
=======================================================================

INPUT FILES STRUCTURE
======================

1. WD_File.csv
   - Key Column: User_Name (for matching)
   - Additional Columns: Worker, Full_Legal_Name, Functional_Business_Unit, Job_Family
   - Purpose: Contains employee workplace data and organizational information

2. All_User_File.csv
   - Key Column: USER_ID (for matching)
   - Additional Columns: EMAIL, USER_TYPE, ORGANIZATION, COST_CENTER, MANAGER
   - Purpose: Master user database with basic user information

3. Salesforce_File.csv
   - Key Column: SalesforceUser_Alias (for matching)
   - Purpose: Contains users who exist in Salesforce system

STEP-BY-STEP PROCESSING LOGIC
=============================

STEP 1: File Loading and Initialization
---------------------------------------
1. Load all three CSV files into pandas DataFrames
2. Handle any file loading errors gracefully
3. Display success message once all files are loaded

STEP 2: Data Normalization for Case-Insensitive Comparison
----------------------------------------------------------
Problem: User IDs and names might have different cases (e.g., "John Smith" vs "JOHN SMITH" vs "john smith")

Solution:
- Convert all comparison columns to lowercase
- Strip leading/trailing whitespace
- This ensures accurate matching regardless of case differences

STEP 3: User Comparison Between Salesforce and All_User Files
-------------------------------------------------------------
Objective: Find which Salesforce users exist in the All_User_File

Process:
1. Get all unique users from Salesforce_File (SalesforceUser_Alias column)
2. For each Salesforce user:
   a. Check if this user exists in All_User_File (USER_ID column)
   b. If found → Add to "existing_users" list
   c. If not found → Add to "non_existing_users" list
3. Extract complete records from All_User_File for existing users

Result: 
- DataFrame with existing users and their complete All_User_File data
- List of users who don't exist in All_User_File

STEP 4: Data Enrichment Based on User Type
-------------------------------------------

4A: For USER_TYPE = "Employee"
------------------------------
Logic: Employees should have their own record in WD_File

Process:
1. Take USER_ID from All_User_File
2. Look for matching User_Name in WD_File
3. If found: Extract Functional_Business_Unit and Job_Family
4. If not found: Mark as "Not Found in WD_File"

Matching Rule: USER_ID (All_User_File) == User_Name (WD_File)

4B: For USER_TYPE = "Contractor" or "Temp User"
-----------------------------------------------
Logic: Contractors don't have their own WD record, so use their manager's data

Process:
1. Take MANAGER name from All_User_File
2. Look for this manager in WD_File in TWO columns:
   - Worker column
   - Full_Legal_Name column
3. If found in either column: Extract manager's Functional_Business_Unit and Job_Family
4. If not found: Mark as "Manager Not Found in WD_File"
5. Assign manager's organizational data to the contractor

Matching Rule: MANAGER (All_User_File) == Worker OR Full_Legal_Name (WD_File)

STEP 5: Final Data Assembly
---------------------------
For each user, compile final record with columns:
- USER_ID (from All_User_File)
- EMAIL (from All_User_File)  
- USER_TYPE (from All_User_File)
- Functional_Business_Unit (from WD_File - based on logic above)
- Job_Family (from WD_File - based on logic above)
- COST_CENTER (from All_User_File)
- ORGANIZATION (from All_User_File)
- MANAGER (from All_User_File)

STEP 6: Output Generation
-------------------------
1. Create final DataFrame with enriched data
2. Save to CSV file: "Final_User_Report.csv"
3. Display summary report showing:
   - All existing users with complete data
   - List of non-existing users
   - Total counts for each category

KEY DESIGN DECISIONS
====================

Case-Insensitive Matching Strategy:
- Problem: Names and IDs might have inconsistent capitalization
- Solution: Normalize all text to lowercase before comparison
- Implementation: normalize_column_data() function handles this uniformly

Contractor Data Inheritance Logic:
- Business Rule: Contractors inherit organizational data from their managers
- Technical Implementation: Look up manager in WD_File and assign their 
  Functional_Business_Unit and Job_Family to contractor
- Fallback: If manager not found, clearly mark as "Manager Not Found in WD_File"

Dual Column Matching for Managers:
- Flexibility: Managers might be listed under either 'Worker' or 'Full_Legal_Name' in WD_File
- Implementation: Use OR condition to check both columns
- Benefit: Increases successful match rate

EXPECTED OUTPUT
===============

Console Display:
1. File loading status
2. Comparison results summary
3. Detailed user lists (existing and non-existing)
4. Processing completion confirmation

CSV File Output:
- Filename: Final_User_Report.csv
- Column Order: USER_ID, EMAIL, USER_TYPE, Functional_Business_Unit, 
  Job_Family, COST_CENTER, ORGANIZATION, MANAGER
- Content: Complete enriched data for all users found in both Salesforce and All_User files

CSV DATA COMPARISON - SIMPLE HIGH-LEVEL EXPLANATION
===================================================

WHAT WE'RE DOING:
- We have 3 CSV files with user information
- We want to combine them into 1 complete report

THE 3 FILES:
1. Salesforce_File → Users in Salesforce system
2. All_User_File → Master user database 
3. WD_File → Employee workplace information

MAIN STEPS:

1. LOAD FILES
   - Read all 3 CSV files

2. FIND COMMON USERS
   - See which Salesforce users also exist in All_User_File
   - Make 2 lists: "Found" and "Not Found"

3. GET EXTRA INFO FOR FOUND USERS
   For each found user, add workplace info from WD_File:
   
   IF user is "Employee":
   → Look up their own record in WD_File
   
   IF user is "Contractor":
   → Look up their manager's record in WD_File
   → Use manager's workplace info for the contractor


4. CREATE FINAL REPORT
   - Combine all information into one table
   - Save as new CSV file
   - Show summary on screen











Login Page → Okta SDK → Okta Authentication API → Okta Verify (MFA) → Event Hook → Okta Workflows → Profile Attributes → ID Token Claims → Security Score







In our hackathon project,
Traditional way:
On our company participant site customer user enters username & password then for MFA it is using twilio message or email code for 2nd Factor then redirects to inside the Website

New way implemented in hackathon:
User enters username and password then redirects to okta verify to enter TOTP or any of the authenticators that are configured and then redirected to inside the website 

For this I hooked Okta SDKs inside the login page which cutoff traditional way and redirects to okta for authentication.

When the user is not enrolled in any MFA, first the user will login into the website in the traditional and a PLA pops up to enroll into the MFA and then way then there is CTA on clicking that it triggers or forces the user to enroll into MFA. That CTA is linked to the url that trigger authenticator enrollment in okta for this I would like to thank Adam the Okta SE for providing this out of the box custom link which is actually not available anywhere publicly on the internet or the documentation After successfull enrollment it triggers an event in okta based on this event in the backend through Okta Event hook and Okat workflows I'm updating values in the profile attributes for example an attribute called mfa_enrolled which is a boolean when it is false it prompts for CTA on the first login and when it is true ir doesn't prompts and another profile attribute totp_enrolled when it is set to true  this value is used to calculate the Security Dashboard score and the users enrolls as much as authenticators it will set those values and those values will be used to compute score. To compute score through Okta ID/access token(here im not sure pls correct which is right) I'm fetching the claims and calulating the score in the frontend. for the respective based on which the PLA/ CTA is promoted.

============================

Technical Script (1–2 min)

"On the technical side, we integrated Okta SDKs directly into the login page to bypass the Standard MFA flow.

When a user logs in, the application calls Okta for the authentication.

If MFA enrollment exists, the user is redirected to Okta Verify or whichever authenticator they’ve enrolled in.

If MFA isn’t set up, we see a PLA is triggered on first login with a CTA button.

This CTA links to a very custom AUthenticator enrollment URL specially provided by Okta.

Once the user completes enrollment, In Okta a event is registered and an Okta Event Hook triggered which in turn triggers Okta Workflows. These workflows update user custom profile attributes for example an attribute calle mfa_enrolled which ia a Boolean which determines the status of MFA enrollment These attributes control how the CTA should appear on first and future logins and oktaverify_enrolled which determines in which authenticator the user has enrolled & We fetch user attributes through the Okta ID Token claims after login Based on the enrolled authenticators, the frontend calculates the Security Dashboard score dynamically.

The profile attributes drive group memberships via group rules. Sign-on policies at the group level decide whether MFA is needed. The number of MFA factors shown depends on the factors the user is already enrolled in

Great!
Kramer, Matt, please let us know when you plan to integrate the Prod environment. We will provide a separate API token exclusively for Prod instances so that we maintain two tokens — one for Prod and one for Non-Prod. The existing token can continue to be used for all Non-Prod instances. When you are ready for the Prod integration, kindly inform us, and we will share the Prod token.
