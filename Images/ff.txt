Absolutely! Let's break down the BeyondInsight and Password Safe REST API guide step by step in a beginner-friendly way, especially focused on using Python.

🔰 What is a REST API?
A REST API lets your program talk to another application (like BeyondInsight/Password Safe) using HTTP (the same way web browsers do).

Imagine you want to ask Password Safe:

“Hey, give me a list of accounts you manage.”

Or “Please log me in first.”
That’s done via REST API calls like GET, POST, etc.

🔐 Authentication & Setup
Before your code can talk to Password Safe, it needs to log in using special credentials.

There are two main ways to authenticate:

API Key Authentication

OAuth Authentication (advanced; usually used in large applications)

For now, let’s focus on API Key authentication, as it's simpler.

🧾 Step-by-Step to Use API with Python
🧰 What you need
An API key (you get this from your BeyondInsight admin)

The RunAs username (a user that has API permissions)

The Password (optional; needed if password factor is enabled)

Python installed

Python module: requests

You can install it using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install requests
🪜 Step 1: Set up Headers
This is like saying:
"Hi Password Safe, I'm this app, running as this user, here's my API key."

python
Copy
Edit
import requests

# Your API credentials here
api_key = "c479a66f...c9484d"  # shortened for example
runas_user = "doe-main\\johndoe"  # include double backslashes in Python
password = "[un1qu3]"  # optional, only if password required

# Combine everything into the authorization header
auth_header = {
    'Authorization': f'PS-Auth key={api_key}; runas={runas_user}; pwd={password};'
}
🪜 Step 2: Start a Session and Sign In
Use a session object to persist your login session.

python
Copy
Edit
# Create session
session = requests.Session()

# Add headers to session
session.headers.update(auth_header)

# API base URL (replace `the-server` with your actual server or cloud URL)
base_url = "https://the-server/BeyondTrust/api/public/v3"

# POST to sign in
sign_in_url = f"{base_url}/Auth/SignAppin"
response = session.post(sign_in_url)

# Check if login was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Login successful!")
else:
    print("Login failed:", response.status_code, response.text)
🪜 Step 3: Make API Calls (e.g., get managed accounts)
After signing in, you can call other endpoints.

python
Copy
Edit
# Example: Get managed accounts
accounts_url = f"{base_url}/ManagedAccounts"
accounts_response = session.get(accounts_url)

if accounts_response.status_code == 200:
    accounts_data = accounts_response.json()  # Get data as Python dict
    print("Managed Accounts:", accounts_data)
else:
    print("Failed to get accounts:", accounts_response.status_code, accounts_response.text)
🪜 Step 4: Log Out (Always do this!)
Logging out cleans up the session on the server.

python
Copy
Edit
# POST to sign out
signout_url = f"{base_url}/Auth/Signout"
signout_response = session.post(signout_url)

if signout_response.status_code == 200:
    print("Logged out successfully.")
else:
    print("Logout failed:", signout_response.status_code, signout_response.text)
🔁 Optional: Two-Factor Challenge
If your admin has enabled two-factor login (e.g., mobile OTP), the first SignAppIn call may return 401 Unauthorized with a special header asking for the challenge.

Then you must:

Read the WWW-Authenticate-2FA header from the first response.

Ask the user to input the OTP or challenge answer.

Retry SignAppIn with the challenge=XXXXXX; in the header.

Let me know if your setup requires 2FA, and I’ll help add that part.

✅ Summary
Step	What You Do
1	Set headers with API key and user
2	Start a session and log in
3	Use GET/POST requests to access features
4	Log out when done

🧪 Test Script Template
Here’s a full minimal working version:

python
Copy
Edit
import requests

# ---- CONFIGURATION ----
api_key = "your_128_char_api_key_here"
runas_user = "yourdomain\\youruser"
password = "[yourpassword]"
base_url = "https://your-server/BeyondTrust/api/public/v3"

# ---- SETUP HEADERS ----
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'PS-Auth key={api_key}; runas={runas_user}; pwd={password};'
}

# ---- SESSION ----
session = requests.Session()
session.headers.update(headers)

# ---- SIGN IN ----
sign_in = session.post(f"{base_url}/Auth/SignAppin")
if sign_in.status_code == 200:
    print("Signed in successfully.")

    # ---- GET MANAGED ACCOUNTS ----
    managed_accounts = session.get(f"{base_url}/ManagedAccounts")
    if managed_accounts.status_code == 200:
        print("Accounts:", managed_accounts.json())
    else:
        print("Error getting accounts:", managed_accounts.text)

    # ---- SIGN OUT ----
    session.post(f"{base_url}/Auth/Signout")
    print("Signed out.")

else:
    print("Sign-in failed:", sign_in.status_code, sign_in.text)
